# Modeling Coastal Water Clarity Using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 version 2 (MOST RECENT)
Tools and resources for ocean color remote sensing of the Virginia Coast Reserve. Can be modified for your water body of interest. Folder contains code for analysis and modeling, resources, code for processing Level-1 Landsat-8/Sentinel-2 images, etc. 

**Overview of workflow:**
1. Download Level-1 Landsat-8 (Collection 1) and Sentinel-2 (bulk download tools available, see below)

2. Process with l2gen in NASA SeaDAS or REMSEM ACOLITE to get Level-2 images (use l2genbash or GUI) - please see: https://github.com/ocean-slang/SeaDAS

3. **algosMatlab** Use Level-2 NetCDF images as inputs to MATLAB code. Code extracts data from images and implements ocean color algorithms (eg. Secchi disk depth, Zsd). 

3a. Optional: **lmnonlinear** Modify Lee et al. 2016 Secchi depth algorithm (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.02.033) using Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm (adjusts free parameters of equation, alternative method instead of linear model)

4. **modeling_and_analysis** R code for modeling and data analysis available. Empirical (linear) fit used to improve satellite Secchi depth estimates. Data for Virginia Coast Reserve included as .csv's
data descriptions and code descriptions in that folder
